Liberica Native Image Kit is a utility capable of converting your JVM-based application into a fully compiled native executable ahead-of-time under the closed-world assumption with an almost instant startup time.
It optimizes resource consumption, minimizes the static footprint, and works on various platforms, including lightweight musl-based Alpine Linux.
